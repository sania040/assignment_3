    <p>Pakistan is a beautiful country with a diverse landscape that includes rugged peaks, hidden villages, wind-swept plains, emerald-green and turquoise-blue valleys, and deserts filled with remnants of ancient civilization. The country is home to 108 peaks above 7,000 meters, including K2, the second-highest mountain in the world². The Swat Valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan is one of the most beautiful places in the country. It has bright green fields and forests, picturesque villages, and rivers boasting shades of blue so clear and bright you wouldn’t have thought them real! The true beauty of Swat can be found around the town of Kalam¹.

        Pakistan has many other beautiful places to visit. Neelum Valley is one of the most popular Pakistan beautiful places. This densely forested area is found in the Azad Kashmir region. Mughal Emperor Humayin once said about this Kashmir area that “if there is a paradise on earth, then this is it.” Visitors usually agree with his well-spoken assessment of the Kashmir Valley today³. Hunza Valley region of northern Pakistan is another beautiful place to visit. The high mountain peaks of the Karakoram range appeal to trekkers and photographers⁴.
        
        Pakistan is also home to many ornate mosques and ancient fortresses. The Badshahi Mosque in Lahore is one of the most iconic landmarks in Pakistan. It was built in 1673 by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and is one of the largest mosques in the world. The Lahore Fort is another beautiful place to visit. It was built in the 16th century and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore is another beautiful mosque that was built in the 17th century. It is known for its intricate tile work and frescoes.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
